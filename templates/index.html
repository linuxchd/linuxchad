<i><h2>What's the deal here?</h2></i>
  <p>
    This place is a home for all my psychological dysfunctioning.<br>
    A place where I am in control, with no restrictions and manupilation.<br>
    A place where my words don't get mixed up with noise.<br>
    Here, you can meet my true self and take a walk inside my head.<br>
